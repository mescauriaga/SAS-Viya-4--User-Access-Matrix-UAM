#User Access Matrix â€“ Column and Row Level Security for CAS Tables Documentation  
 
Product: Information Catalog   
Version: SAS Viya 4  
Date: 12/04/2023 

This code provides means to implement Row-level and Column-level securities within SAS Viya's CAS in an automated way. The code relies from a file (WHITELIST_CONTROL_UAM.csv), wherein the library, table, row, column and conditions are present.

Note that:
1. SAS Visual Analytics, column-level access is not supported and can yield unexpected results.
